Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.
  1. The div element is used to group or block other elements together. Stylistically, it dictates a new line.
  2. The class attribute is an identifier that groups similar types of elements allowing for easier styling.
  3. The id attribute gives a unique identifier to an element. It is helpful when you want to style that element independently or you want to create a link that navigates to a specific part of the page.
  4. The span element is similar to the div element in that both block of a specific are of the page stylistically, but span does this inline and multiple span elements can exist within a div element.


What is "alt text," and why do we use it?

Alt text gives context to what a piece of media is. It is displayed when a browser cannot read or render a specific file and lets the user know what ought to be there. Alt text is also used in vision impaired technology that reads to a user.


Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

When I first read the assignment, I knew immediately what song on which to base my project. I love Nora Jones, and her song Come Away With Me was my husband and I's first dance. Because the song choice was so easy, I could gather my lyrics, images, and video rather quickly. I started off by browsing the course website and then moved over to the walkthrough. The walkthrough got me started but following the directions on the Moodle shell was surprisingly the most effective means of completion for me this time. The only thing I got a little hung up on was the audio. I really wanted the whole song, but only the first 30 seconds were available on sound cloud. I decided to go with the sample rather than searching for a full version because I really wanted the rich quality of the instrumental and her specific voice rather than a cover. I never realized that the share buttons on Google maps, YouTube, SoundCloud, etc. include the code for embedding media and that made this project much easier.
