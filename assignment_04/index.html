    <h1>Zebra Question</h1>
    <h3>By Shel Silverstein</h3>
    <hr>
    <pre>
      I asked the zebra,
      Are you black with white stripes?
      Or white with black stripes?
      And the zebra asked me,
      Are you good with bad habits?
      Or are you bad with good habits?
      Are you noisy with quiet times?
      Or are you quiet with noisy times?
      Are you happy with some sad days?
      Or are you sad with some happy days?
      Are you neat with some sloppy ways?
      Or are you sloppy with some neat ways?
      And on and on and on and on
      And on and on he went.
      I'll never ask a zebra
      About stripes
      Again.
