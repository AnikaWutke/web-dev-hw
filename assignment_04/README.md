1. I went to the University of Montana Website. It had a similar structure to the current website. The heading tabs are the same. The biggest difference I noticed was the main logo. The logo from 10 years ago focused on the clock tower and uses a serif font rather than the current san-serif font. The old logo is much busier than the current logo that just uses the "m" curve of the mountain as the graphic element.
2. The Git module worked for me at the beginning because it laid out the goals of the lesson and that really helped me wrap my head around what I was supposed to know. However, when it came time to do the step by step guide, I got a little lost. I successfully got my desktop app and gihub.com connected, but I got overwhelmed after that and turned to the video tutorials instead.
