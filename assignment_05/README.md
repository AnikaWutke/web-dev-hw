1. How many main document `<head>` and `<body>` elements can a page have? How are these elements different, or what role do they play?

  Only one `<head>` and `<body` element are allowed in an html page. The head element contains information about the html content for processing more so than viewership. It also contains metadata. The body element contains information that the viewer reads/sees as a web page. This information determines how a page is rendered and displayed.

2. Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.

  Structural markup dictates the structural elements of a page such as headings, paragraphs, breaks, and lists. Semantic markup dictates and emphasizes meanings or semantics of whatâ€™s read in the page. This includes things like italics, bold, strikethroughs, citations, and more.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

  I started by looking at Moodle and checking the requirements for the assignment itself. I always copy and paste the README.md questions into a Google docs page so I can answer them as I progress. I then navigated over to the course website and read the materials there, adding to the response questions as I read. The recipe I chose was Betty Crocker Fudge brownies because I made some recently and could easily take a picture. I also wanted to pick this because my grandma changes the recipe slightly and her brownies are so much better. I just thought this would be a fun and simple way for me to work on the structure of the web page without worrying as much about the content itself. I then went over to the walkthrough video to double check myself and make sure I was doing everything correctly. Once I finished that, I added my recipe content to my index file (checking as I went) until I was satisfied with the page.
