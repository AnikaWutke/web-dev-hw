1. Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do the serve?

  I come across multiple login forms. These forms take usually a username and password in order to give me, the user, access to the site and my profile. I also use Google quite often. This website is essentially one form on its home page. The data I enter is sent to a server and results answering my query are presented back.


2. List examples of a text, selection, and button input, and where they might be used.
 
    a. One type of text input is password. A single line of text is created and the characters in that line are hidden with a dot or *
This is great for login forms especially when a user is requesting access to a more secure site.
 
   b. One type of selection input is the radio button. This input tells the browser that only one option may be selected. This is great for online quizzes or surveys where only one answer is correct or necessary to gather.
 
   c. One type of button input is the image button. This replaces any standard button with something more customized. It is great for adding personality and character to a website. Something as simple as a "Submit button" can make a website feel more unique if it is more graphically appealing.


3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

  This week's work cycle was a little more difficult for me. I started off by reading the assignment on Moodle and then navigating over to the course website. This was super dense for me to just read, so I watched the work along video and followed as much as I could. After getting to the point where I felt comfortable moving forward to customize my own page, I looked for a store on which to base my project. I chose Mild Fence because it is where I worked this summer. The submit button I chose was similar in color to the business itself (green and white) and I liked that the ribbon-like quality of the button made it feel like the user was crossing some kind of finish line as they completed the form.
