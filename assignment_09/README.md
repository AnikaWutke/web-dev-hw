1. Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?

  Universal selectors style every element on the page. This is helpful when defining an overall background color or font for a website (something that will not change).

  Element selectors style specific elements of the page such as headings, paragraphs, etc. and are helpful to specify style but it is still relatively structural.

  Class selectors get more specific and style elements that tend to serve the same function but may need some variety. Classes can apply to multiple elements and divs.

  ID selectors specify style for only elements with the matching ID. These can be helpful if a designer wants to deviate from the overall design to add emphasis to an element.

2. Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes.

  I chose DEEPPINK, DIMGRAY, and YELLOWGREEN as my three main colors. I chose to operate with color names rather than choosing rgb values or hex codes because it was easier for me to visualize my page this time around. I took a lot of inspiration from a scrunchy I’ve had since the early 2000’s as far as color goes and then I gravitated toward the grunge movement and found that a lot of movie and band posters had high contrast with darker dingy backgrounds and one or two bright colors. I liked this look and ran with it for my own palette.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

  I started off by reading through the color module this time and then read the assignment parameters. I had a hard time choosing a decade so I told my husband to name one and he said the 90s. I started looking at digital art, fashion, and lots of posters. I ended up really liking the high contrast in a lot of pieces from the grunge movement and went from there as far as design goes. I chose three simple images and decided to play with headers and footers to bookend the page which was more difficult than I expected. The work along video helped me organize divs in my head and then go to work coding. Positioning was really hard for me. I tried to do the “canvas” thing and I couldn’t quite get it, so things are not as aligned or as centered as I would like, but I did the best I could and kinda dig how it turned out.
