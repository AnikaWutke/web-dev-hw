1. Did you learn anything new about web development (ie using GitHub, version control, repositories)?

  Web development was completely new to me. I understood the necessity to have a website, but I didn't know much else. The idea of version control is great to me, especially since I would like to tinker more with development.

2. Did you learn anything new about web design (ie using media, color, fonts)?

  As far as design goes, I thought it would be much more difficult to import video and was pleasantly surprised. The same goes for images and fonts. I did learn more about the importance of readability on the web and that is the factor that most influences my design choices.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

  I started with the navigation bar because I didn't quite get it right in the last assignment. I had fun making a logo for myself but probably spent too much time on this aspect in retrospect. I found myself getting a little too ambitious because I was trying to use skills I didn't have. For example, I wanted to do a cool hover feature on my home page where each image gets color and a title, but I ended up trying a bunch of things on my own and they didn't quite work out. I plan on expanding this website in the future as I do really enjoy my color palette and fonts. I feel like, in concept, by website was very representative of me, but not as much in execution. I am glad to have taken this class and would like to learn more about web design and development.
