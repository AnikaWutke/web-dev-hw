BRUTUS
Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,
But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,
And say you do 't by our permission.
Else shall you not have any hand at all
About his funeral. And you shall speak
In the same pulpit whereto I am going,
After my speech is ended.
  </pre>
  <pre class="dialogue" id="l2">
ANTONY
Be it so.
I do desire no more.
 </pre>
 <pre class="dialogue" id="l3">
BRUTUS
Prepare the body then, and follow us.

Exeunt. Manet ANTONY

ANTONY
O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
That ever lived in the tide of times.
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy-
Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips
To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue-
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men.
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy.
Blood and destruction shall be so in use,
And dreadful objects so familiar,
That mothers shall but smile when they behold
Their infants quartered with the hands of war,
All pity choked with custom of fell deeds,
And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,
With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war,
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
With carrion men, groaning for burial.

Enter OCTAVIUS' SERVANT

You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?
</pre>
<pre class="dialogue" id="l5">
OCTAVIUS' SERVANT
I do, Mark Antony.
</pre>
<pre class="dialogue" id="l6">
ANTONY
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
</pre>
<pre class="dialogue" id="l7">
OCTAVIUS' SERVANT
He did receive his letters and is coming.
And bid me say to you by word of mouth-
(sees CAESAR's body) O Caesar!-
</pre>
<pre class="dialogue" id="l8">
ANTONY
Thy heart is big. Get thee apart and weep.
Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes,
Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,
Began to water. Is thy master coming?
</pre>
<pre class="dialogue" id="l9">
OCTAVIUS' SERVANT
He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.
</pre>
<pre class="dialogue" id="l10">
ANTONY
Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced.
Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,
No Rome of safety for Octavius yet.
Hie hence, and tell him so. -Yet, stay awhile.
Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
Into the marketplace. There shall I try,
In my oration, how the people take
The cruel issue of these bloody men.
According to the which, thou shalt discourse
To young Octavius of the state of things.
Lend me your hand.

Exeunt with CAESAR's body
