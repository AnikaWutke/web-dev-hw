    <h2>Why Loose Leaf Tea?</h2>
    <p>I chose this particular project because I love tea. I remember wanting
      to be able to brew loose leaf tea because I had heard it was so much
      better but didnâ€™t know how. I now have lots of different kinds of loose
      leaf tea and accessories! I find the history fascinating and wanted to
      share, at least in some way, a hobby and part of my morning that has
      become routine.</p>
    <p>To learn more about loose leaf tea and the company behind my favorite
      teas, check out this short documentary about <a href="https://lakemissoulateacompany.com/">
        Lake Missoula Tea Company</a>.</p>
