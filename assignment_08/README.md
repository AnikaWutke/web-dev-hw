Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?

  1. All of HTML is new for me. I have never done coding before aside from attempting to read some this summer for work. I found it to be a relatively easy language to learn because it felt so straightforward. The idea of elements made a lot of sense, but keeping in mind which are closed and which can be open was a little difficult.

Next module we begin CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section.

  2. I am excited for this section because I feel like it will give more freedom to act creatively and design. That being said, I am nervous that this will be a much harder language to learn simply because it dictates very specific aspects of a website and I foresee that getting complicated. I am also a little anxious to make CSS and HTML work together and am curious how that will flow.

Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

  3. I started this work cycle by reading the requirements for this assignment and realizing that I wanted to dedicate more time to this project. I chose right away to deal with brewing tea because it is a simple process, so I could put more time into creating my images and styling, and I also love tea and am dealing with it aesthetically in my senior project. After I chose my subject matter, I started a document in which I wrote out each step so I would not have to do it later. I then took pictures of tea and made a submit button so that I had all of my materials. I then started coding and experimenting with style. Once I chose my color palette, I was able to add the content relatively quickly. I used a lot of the reference links in the website to double check that I had all the necessary parts of each element especially when it came to forms. Overall, I enjoyed making the content for this website.
