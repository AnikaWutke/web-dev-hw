    <h2>Before We Get Started:</h2>
    <p>Tea is an art that has developed over thousands of years.
      There are a ton of varieties of teas in flavor and form.
      White, green, black, and oolong are just a few different types of tea.
      They can come pre-bagged or loose. Loose leaf tea is much closer to what
      traditional tea ought to be, and, in my opinion, is much deeper in flavor
     and tastes better overall. Loose leaf tea can be daunting to brew for the
     first time, but a few simple steps can get you on your way to the perfect brew.</p>
    <p>
      <b>For this process, you will need:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Your Choice of Loose Leaf Tea</li>
        <li>A Tea Infuser or Strainer</li>
        <li>Something to Boil Water</li>
        <li>A Cup or Mug of Choice</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p><b>Step 1</b>
      <br />
      Pick your tea and read the instructions if it comes with any.
      I chose a white tea that I got from Lake Missoula Tea Company.
      White teas, because they are the lightest, need a lower temperature of
      water to properly steep otherwise they will cook. The water should hit
      about 170<sup>o</sup>F. If you have no thermometer or would rather not
      dig one out of your drawer, boil some water and let it sit for about two
      minutes off the heat so that it reduces in temperature.</p>

    <p><b>Step 2</b>
      <br />
      While your water is cooling, measure 1tb of tea leaves for every 8oz of
      tea you would like. Add the leaves to an infuser. Please note
      that the tea leaves will expand, doubling and sometimes tripling in size,
      so give them some room to breathe. I will sometimes make more tea in a
      french press just to give the leaves room to grow. If you do not have an
      infuser, you could add leaves to any cup or container during the brewing
      process and strain the liquid into another cup with a mesh sifter to catch
      the leaves.

    <p><b>Step 3</b>
      <br />
      Pour the hot water over the leaves and let them steep for 3 minutes.
      Do not over-steep the leaves as this could cause the tea to turn bitter.
      A big part of brewing the perfect cup of tea is dependent on you. If you
      want a more full flavor, add more leaves than necessary. If you want a
      stronger cup of tea (like me), steep it for a little longer (or shorter
      for a weaker cup). Experiment after trying it once the instructed way,
      get to know your preferences, and enjoy your cup of tea.
